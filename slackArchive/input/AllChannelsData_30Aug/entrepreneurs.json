But some of them, like \"experience being famous\" don't seem like they may do good, but it can still be regarded as a profitable tourist idea. \n\nA random example of an experience based service: a service which allows you to live an olden day life for a day or two (I mean, without electricity, phones and stuff. In the middle of a village, with just nothing but ancient utensils... gramophone etc) might be worth trying. I don't know if there are any services like that. But things like this will be a lot of fun. And creating a market out of it could benefit the society and draw in open minded people.\n\nP.S.

      "text": "<@UMA76UQJD> it's some interesting ideas! I wouldn't say that my main focus is on maslow's hierarcy, i think it's just a neat little idea which backs-up my hunch that there's a growing  (and largely unmet) demand for experience based products. My guess is that demand for these sorts of commodities(?) will grow much more as economies become more service-based, and manufacturing/primary industry goes full robot.\n\nOn your other point about the dopamine aspect,  i've often been held back by this thought; that willful engagement of people into almost any kind of business model is akin to selling likes on facebook, ie the dopamine cycle is always a fundamental force that's being exploited at some level. However i'm not sure there's any way to escape that particular circuit until humans are able to leave their bodies. until then, i think growth, expansion and moderated addictions should be encouraged and profited from. i guess the key question is, as usual; what kind of growth, and to what end? I agree that the celebrity for a day thing is like selling canned narcisism -  without getting too philosophical, there's definitely more ethical ways to provide people an uplifting experience. You could even avoid the whole dilemma and simply provide a platform for people to efficiently organize / share/ discover their own methods?",

There is a chance that making someone famous for 2 hrs could become addictive (I could be wrong). External means do not always help. \n\nSocial networks make use of this unrest within people to make money. Giving people a dopamine boost, through likes, comments and shares, never cause them to stop doing what they keep doing: spending time on social media. Instead it just keeps increasing. Giving people a dopamine boost for money is exactly like selling \"social media likes\" to users. Again, this is just my view and I could be wrong. \n\nI think the only way someone can satisfy the hierarchy is by wanting to be satisfied with what they have. By the way, the Japanese Samurai thing was awesome! I really want to try that some day!",

Exposing people to fame, for example, will make them understand how famous people have their own challenges. Or simply being exposed to such a situation will make them get used to it, not wanting it anymore and thus fulfilling one of the levels in the hierarchy. This must help them move one level up, in the hierarchy. More like how a child will be very excited about his new flying helicopter (toy), and later get used to playing with it (causing it to remain under a bundle of toys, forgotten, forever).",
