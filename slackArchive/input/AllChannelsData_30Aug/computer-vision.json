I was both happy to see distinct clusters, but at the same time it was difficult to discern visual patterns in said clusters. I was wondering if there is a method of deep clustering that would enable weights for characteristics of the images, for example, the shape or color.\n\nI read my first paper about autoencoders today and tried searching for variations that would enable this to no luck. I was curious if anyone knew of a direction or keywords that would be useful.",
